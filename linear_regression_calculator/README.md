# Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator

## Overview

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning certification, where the goal is to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. The project was completed using Google Colaboratory, and the dataset consists of various attributes related to individuals' healthcare costs. The objective is to train a linear regression model to predict healthcare expenses within a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than $3500.

Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
Overview
This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning certification, where the goal is to predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm. The project was completed using Google Colaboratory, and the dataset consists of various attributes related to individuals' healthcare costs. The objective is to train a linear regression model to predict healthcare expenses within a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of less than $3500.

Project Description
In this project, I worked with a dataset that includes demographic and lifestyle information such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, region, and medical expenses. The task was to develop a regression model to predict healthcare expenses based on these attributes.

The key steps of the project are as follows:

- Data Preprocessing: Converting categorical data into numerical values.
- Splitting Data: Dividing the dataset into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).
- Model Training: Building a linear regression model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Model Evaluation: Testing the model's accuracy by evaluating its Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test dataset.
- Results Visualization: Plotting the predicted healthcare expenses versus the true expenses.

## Dataset

The dataset used is from freeCodeCamp's repository: insurance.csv.

- Features:
    - age: Age of the individual
    - sex: Gender of the individual
    - bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI)
    - children: Number of children
    - smoker: Whether the individual is a smoker
    - region: The region where the individual resides
    - expenses: Annual medical expenses (target variable)

# Implementation

## Libraries Used

- TensorFlow: For building and training the regression model.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- Matplotlib: For plotting the results and visualizing the model's predictions.
- NumPy: For handling numerical computations.

## Key Steps

1. Importing Libraries and Data

All necessary libraries were imported, including TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset was loaded using pandas.read_csv().

2. Data Preprocessing

- Converted categorical columns (sex, smoker, region) into numerical values using .astype('category').cat.codes.
- Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets.
- Popped off the expenses column from the dataset to create train_labels and test_labels.

3. Model Creation and Training

- A simple Sequential model with two Dense layers was created using Keras.
- A normalization layer was added to scale the inputs.
- The model was compiled using the Adam optimizer, Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the loss function, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a performance metric.
- The model was trained using 100 epochs with a validation split of 0.2.

4. Model Evaluation

The model was evaluated using the test dataset, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) below 3500, successfully passing the project challenge.

5. Results Visualization

A scatter plot was generated to compare the predicted medical expenses with the true values.

## Results

- Final MAE: 3473.13
- Visualization: The plot shows how closely the predicted expenses align with the true expenses, indicating the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how to preprocess a dataset, build a linear regression model using TensorFlow and Keras, and visualize the results to evaluate the model's performance. The trained model successfully predicted healthcare expenses within a MAE of $3500, meeting the projectâ€™s requirements.
