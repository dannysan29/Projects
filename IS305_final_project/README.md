# Introduction to Data Processing in Python

## Project Description

This project was made during my Fall 2023 semester at UIUC. It submitted this assignment as part of my final project. The main takeaway from this project is using data processing with python and sql. Throughout the semester, we used more data processing tools in python with csv files given and eventually to manage the data, we moved onto sqlite. The main idea of this project is to teach a particular python module and the idea was to visualize yourself teaching this module to high school students interested in coding. For the applicable example, I used the chicago bears history dataset obtained from 'pro-football-reference.com'.

## Requirements

- python
- 'sqlite' library
- 'pandas' library
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

Run the project using the following command:

Final Project.py

This will generate the sqlite commands and create a database that will appear in your explorer panel.
