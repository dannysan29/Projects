# Projects

A collection of projects to enhance my skills.

**Danny Soria**

I am a graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign looking to find a data analyst where I aspire to become a leader in a company. You can see my GitHub repository for projects I have worked on to develop my skills required for the data science field. Thank you and hope you enjoy it! 

P.S. If you want to email me for recommendations on one of my projects, you are more than welcome to contact me through email: dsoria493@gmail.com.
